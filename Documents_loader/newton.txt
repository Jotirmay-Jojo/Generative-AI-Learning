Newton's laws of motion are three fundamental principles that describe the relationship between an object's motion and the forces acting on it. The first law states an object at rest or in motion will stay that way unless acted upon by an unbalanced force (inertia). The second law mathematically relates force, mass, and acceleration with the formula \(F=ma\). The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Newton's First Law of Motion Statement: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.Concept: This property is called inertia, and it's why objects resist changes in their state of motion.Example: A person in a car continues to move forward when the car suddenly stops because of inertia. A seatbelt provides the unbalanced force to stop the person along with the car. Newton's Second Law of Motion Statement: The acceleration of an object is dependent on the net force acting upon the object and its mass.Formula: \(F=ma\) (Force equals mass times acceleration).Concept: A larger force results in a larger acceleration, while a larger mass results in a smaller acceleration for the same force. The SI unit for force is the Newton (\(N\)).Example: Pushing a shopping cart with more force makes it accelerate faster. For the same amount of force, a heavier cart (greater mass) will accelerate less than a lighter one. Newton's Third Law of Motion Statement: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.Concept: When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force of the same magnitude in the opposite direction on the first object.Example: When a rocket expels gas downward (the action), the gas pushes the rocket upward (the reaction). Another example is when a swimmer pushes water backward with their hands to move forward.
